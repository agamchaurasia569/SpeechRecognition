# SpeechRecognition
Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is a technology that enables computers to understand and process human speech. The basic process involves converting spoken words into text.

The basic process involves converting spoken words into text. Here's a simple description of how it works:

Audio Input: The system receives audio input through a microphone.

Preprocessing: The audio signal is cleaned and prepared by removing noise and normalizing the volume.

Feature Extraction: Key characteristics or features of the audio signal, such as frequency and amplitude, are extracted. Common techniques include Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and spectrogram analysis.

Acoustic Model: The extracted features are matched against an acoustic model, which represents the relationship between audio signals and phonetic units (basic sounds of speech).

Language Model: The recognized phonetic units are then processed by a language model that uses context to predict and form coherent words and sentences.

Decoding: The final step involves decoding the processed data into text that represents the spoken words.
